# Stewart Williamson
### I am a Univeristy of North Texas Graduate with a Bachelor's in Biology with Minor in Chemistry and Speech Pathology, and I also completed some post-bachelor courses focusing on Environmental Sciences. However, now I am enrolled with Savvy Coders to kickstart my Career in Data Sciences.

## My goals for Savvy Coders
### - Become more proficient with Python
### - Getting Comfortable with Whiteboarding
### - Learn Tableau
### - And finally, become a Data Analyst

## Some Python articles that I found interesting:
### - [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/introduction-to-machine-learning/?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=%20Python)
### - [Implenting Logistic Regression from Scratch in Python](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/implementing-logistic-regression-from-scratch-in-python/?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=%20Python)
### - [Introduction to Data Fabric](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/introduction-to-data-fabric/?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=%20Python)

## My inspiration

### This is my wife and I on our first trip to see the Arch after we had just had gotten married and moved to Saint Louis. At the time I was pursuing my career in Laboratory Sciences and I thought that was the career for me. However, as time went by, I realized that my current line of work wasn't for me but I had gained an interest in data sciences and coding. The moment captured in this picture reminds me of how I was able to overcome the hardships and obstacles of finding a job during the pandemic, moving so far from home, and still gathering up the energy each day to do my best in my, then current role so my wife and I could have better lives. Since leaving my previous career, I've been ready to put in the same amount of effort, if not more, to obtain this career path that I desire, in Data Sciences.
