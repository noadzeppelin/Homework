### This is my wife and I on our first trip to see the Arch after we had just had gotten married and moved to Saint Louis. At the time I was pursuing my career in Laboratory Sciences and I thought that was the career for me. However, as time went by, I realized that my current line of work wasn't for me but I had gained an interest in data sciences and coding. The moment captured in this picture reminds me of how I was able to overcome the hardships and obstacles of finding a job during the pandemic, moving so far from home, and still gathering up the energy each day to do my best in my, then current role so my wife and I could have better lives. Since leaving my previous career, I've been ready to put in the same amount of effort, if not more, to obtain this career path that I desire, in Data Sciences.
